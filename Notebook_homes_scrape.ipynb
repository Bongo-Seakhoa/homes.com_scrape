This house was a mansion at the time it was built. The main house boasts 3183 Sqft in Living Space and an attached 500 Sqft ADU that has 2 beds and 2 baths in the back which was recently built in 2019; making it a total of 7 beds, 5 baths and almost 3700 Sqft in living area. BEST OF ALL, this property possesses an enormous lot of 0.76 Acre ~ 33,120 Sqft with a RS-3 ZONING, 160.5Ft frontage which would allow you to split this lot into at least 3 different smaller lots of approximately 11,000 Sqft each for investment purposes. You will then have 3 different lots with 3 different parcel numbers, each lot can have a big house with an ADU and a JADU on it and still have plenty of land for enjoyment. The current owners has submitted architectural plan for lot splitting to the city in the pass and it was approved. However, they did not proceed with it. You can re-apply if you want to turn this great vision into life. This means that this property is good for both your own enjoyment and from an investment stand point with the multi-residential zoning that it holds. Oversized lot like this is already a rare find, and not all the large lot property could be divided into multiple parcels, not if it is located in an interior tract. Furthermore, facing a big street like Magnolia Ave, you could potentially acquire CUP (Conditional Used Permit) for other commercial uses of the property like Barn Style Wedding Venue, Coffee Shop or how about a Buddhist Temple? Additionally, the property would also qualify to be a historic home if you would like to apply for this status with the city and county. There was suggestion but owners chose not to do it, this would immensely helps reduce your property tax rate. These are the features that make this piece of real estate so special and completely stand out from the rest. What are the chances you will find something like this come by again in this super low inventory market? This is really a Real Estate Jewel. The 4 years old ADU has 10Ft high ceiling and air-conditioning units for both bedrooms. To add cherries on top, this property is 5-10 mins drive from freeway 5 and 22 entrances.

Every surface and system inside and outside the property is new—with the exception of the original hardwood floors, vaulted wood ceiling, and wood burning fireplace—as envisioned by the famed Designer for her Laguna Beach sanctuary. The cottage lives large with vaulted beamed ceilings and matte white custom milled wood-clad walls with cleverly hidden display/storage cabinets. The gorgeous living room highlights a bespoke hand-carved wood mantle surround and marble hearth fireplace and opens to the panoramic view deck and lush backyard garden. A well-appointed kitchen features a luxe Lacanche 5-burner gas range and is adjacent to the sunny breakfast/bistro room looking out to the aromatic garden courtyard. The sublime formal dining room hides a secret green lacquered \"speakeasy\" bar.

Build your dream home or Renovate & Expand the current modern contemporary residence. Either way, enjoy spectacular and unobstructed ocean, harbor, Catalina Island, sunset and city lights views from almost every room. Perched high on the bluff in Irvine Terrace, this is the widest (~126’ SqFt) and largest (~20,000 SqFt) lot on the front-row street of Dolphin Terrace, and is more than double the width of many view lots in the neighborhood. Currently configured as a 4 bedroom, 6 bath home, the gym has a private full bath and large closet and could be utilized as a 5th bedroom.  The primary suite and one additional bedroom suite are located on the main floor for easy single-level living, if desired.  The property also offers large living & dining areas and an open kitchen / great room; all with floor-to-ceiling walls of glass and numerous skylights. Additionally, there are two offices, a bonus room with bar, and a spacious laundry room. On top of approximately 6,100 SqFt of living space (potentially Expandable to ~8,000 SqFt), there is nearly 1,250 SqFt of additional interior walk-in storage space.  An expansive 3-car garage with high ceilings that may accommodate car lifts and a separate workshop rounds-out this offering.  As for the exterior amenities, there is a private, gated entry courtyard with a 50' lap pool, three view decks, an ocean view spa, covered loggia and a grassy back yard. The slope of the bluff is conveniently terraced with thoughtfully placed walkways and seating areas throughout the beautiful gardens that meander all the way down to Bayside Drive. With proper vision and execution, this New Build or Renovation project has the potential to be a true trophy property within the Corona del Mar community. There is also a possibility that the current lot may be able to be split into 2 lots. While the property possesses the basic City parameters necessary for this to take place, the process would also entail getting approval for a change to the General City Plan, as well as getting an Amendment to the Irvine Terrace CC&Rs approved, among other things, which could take 6 months to 1 year or longer to go through the process, and it is not guaranteed to be successful.
